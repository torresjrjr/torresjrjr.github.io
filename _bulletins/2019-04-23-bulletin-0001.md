# New restructuring of website
The website has made some improvements:
- A new bulletin board for updates.
- New post customisation and metadata available to use.

The following are potential improvements:
- A chat feature.
- Customisable site themes, also linked with `liquid` to posts.
- More user identity design, like:
  - Coupled profile pictures.
  - Statuses.
- A working shell.
