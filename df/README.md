README.md
=========

This dir was used to sync a simple .vimrc . I've since then used an entire GH repo named .vim which 
I use to sync my .vim/vimrc, mappings, and plugins. This dir isn't useful for now.

The df.sh is a bash script I would curl to my devices, and it would pull any files it specified, 
which was only a .vimrc file at the time.
